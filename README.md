# 10000-Dice
C++ dice game created with objects in mind.

This is a C++ implementation of the game called 10000 Dice. It's simple and is played with 6 dice and as many players as you want. 
You can read about it on Wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_10000. It also goes by the names Dice 10000 and Chicken.

I've utilized objects to make the program modular and easily multiplayer. In the future, I'd like to min-max it and add a computer AI to play against,
as well as a mode where the computer can explain the best move in every circumstance and why.
